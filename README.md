4) A bottle factory produces bottles of equal mass. During a production, the weight of one of the
bottles is set incorrectly. The factory scale will be used to find this bottle. Design a decrease-andconquer algorithm which finds the that bottle. Analyze the worst-case, best-case and average-case
complexities of your algorithm. Explain your algorithm in the report file.
